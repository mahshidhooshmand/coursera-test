    Cognitive Assessment and Case Formulation
Various critical reviews have been published on the cognitive and symptom measures
specifically developed for social anxiety (e.g., D. B. Clark et al., 1997; Heimberg &
Turk, 2002; Hofmann & Barlow, 2002; Turk, Heimberg, & Magee, 2008). In this section we focus on a few of the more common symptom measures as well as a couple of
specific questionnaires that assess the cognitive profile of social phobia. We begin with a
brief consideration of standardized instruments for social phobia and end with a framework for case formulation derived from the current model.
Diagnostic Interview and Clinician Ratings
The ADIS-IV (Brown et al., 1994) is recommended over the SCID-IV (First et al., 1997)
when administering a structured diagnostic interview for social phobia. Reliability studies (Brown et al., 2001) indicate that the ADIS-IV Lifetime Version achieved high interrater reliability for diagnosis of social phobia (kappa = .73) and for dimensional ratings
of situational fear (r = .86), avoidance (r = .68), and severity of general interference or
distress (r = .80). If a clinician rating scale is desired, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale
(LSAS; Liebowitz, 1987) is recommended. It has good psychometric properties, with a
LSAS Total cutoff score of 30 distinguishing social phobia from nonclinical individuals
(Fresco et al., 2001; Heimberg et al., 1999; Mennin et al., 2002). The LSAS is reprinted
in the original article as well as in Heimberg and Turk (2002).
Symptom Questionnaires
Social Phobia Scale and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale
The 20-item Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and 20-item Social Interaction Anxiety Scale
(SIAS) are companion scales developed by Mattick and Clarke (1998) to assess fear of
being observed by others while doing routine tasks and fear of more general social interaction. Both scales have good internal consistency (Cronbach alphas range from .88 to
.94), high 12 week test–retest reliability of .92 (SIAS) and .93 (SPS), strong concurrent
validity, and adequate convergent validity with interview-based indices of social anxiety
as well as measures of negative cognition (Brown, Turovsky, et al., 1997; Cox, Ross,
Swinson, & Direnfeld, 1998; Mattick & Clarke, 1998; Osman, Gutierrez, Barrios, Kopper, & Chiros, 1998; Ries et al., 1998). Social phobics score significantly higher than
other anxiety disorder groups or nonclinical controls (e.g., Brown et al., 1997; Mattick
& Clarke, 1998), and the SPS and SIAS are sensitive to cognitive-behavioral treatment
effects (Cox et al., 1998). Peters (2000) reported that a cutoff score of 26 on the SPS
and 36 on the SIAS were optimal for discriminating social phobia from panic disorder,
362 TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC ANXIETY DISORDERS
whereas Brown et al. (1997) note that cutoff scores of 24 (SPS) and 34 (SIAS) may be
useful for screening but not diagnosing social phobia. Copies of the questionnaires can
be found in Orsillo (2001, Appendix B) or Mattick and Clarke (1998), where all items
are reproduced except SIAS item 5.
Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory
The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) is a 45-item empirically derived questionnaire that assesses physical, cognitive, and behavioral responses to various social
interaction, performance, and observation situations (Turner, Beidel, Dancu, & Stanley, 1989). The administration and scoring of the SPAI are more complex and timeconsuming than other social anxiety questionnaires. The questionnaire includes a
13-item Agoraphobia subscale that was included to provide a better differentiation of
social phobia from agoraphobia (Beidel & Turner, 2007). The SPAI Total score is calculated by subtracting the total score on the Agoraphobia subscale from the Social Anxiety subscale score, which is intended to be a “purer” measure of social phobia (Turner,
Stanley, Beidel & Bond, 1989).
The SPAI Social Anxiety and Agoraphobia subscales have acceptable internal consistency (alphas range from .83 to .97; D. B. Clark et al., 1994; Osman et al., 1996), and
SPAI Total has a 2-week test–retest reliability of .86 (Turner et al., 1989). In addition
the SPAI correlates highly with other measures of social anxiety and related constructs
(Beidel, Turner, Stanley, & Dancu, 1989; Cox et al., 1998; Osman et al., 1996; Ries et
al., 1998), and discriminates social phobia from other anxiety disorders and nonclinical
controls (D. B. Clark et al., 1994; Peters, 2000; Turner, Beidel et al., 1989). In addition
individuals with generalized social phobia score significantly higher than those with
the circumscribed subtype (Ries et al., 1998). It is also sensitive to treatment effects
(Cox et al., 1998) and factor analysis confirms the existence of separate social anxiety
and agoraphobic dimensions (Osman et al., 1996; Turner, Stanley, et al., 1989). Peters
(2000) recommends a SPAI Total cutoff score of 88 to distinguish social phobia from
panic disorder, whereas the manual recommends a cutoff of 60 for distinguishing social
phobia in treatment-seeking samples (Turner, Beidel, & Dancu, 1996). However, cutoff
scores must be used cautiously and for screening only since 10% of nonclinical individuals score above the cutoff (Gillis, Haaga, & Ford, 1995). An abbreviated 23-item
SPAI was recently developed that holds promise as a comparable measure to the original
inventory (Robertson-Ny, Strong, Nay, Beidel, & Turner, 2007). The 45–item SPAI can
be purchased from Multi-Health Systems Inc. (Turner et al., 1996).
Clinician Guideline 9.14
Assessment for social phobia should include the ADIS-IV (current or lifetime version) and
one of the specialized symptom questionnaires. Either the SPAI or the SPS and SIAS companion scales will provide comparable clinical information on social anxiety severity as well
as an evaluation of treatment effectiveness.
Social Phobia 363
Cognitive Questionnaires of Social Anxiety
Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale
The Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNE) is the most widely used questionnaire in
social anxiety because it assesses a core cognitive feature of the disorder, fear of negative
evaluation. The 30-item true/false scale was originally developed by Watson and Friend
(1969) to assess expectation, apprehension, distress, and avoidance of social evaluative situations. It was intended to be administered along with its companion scale, the
28-item Social Avoidance and Distress Scale (SAD). Although the FNE demonstrates
good reliability and correlates with other measures of social anxiety especially in university student samples, questions have been raised about its divergent validity with
depression and general distress as well as its differential sensitivity to diagnosable social
phobia (see D. B. Clark et al., 1997; Hope et al., 1996–1997).
Leary (1983) developed a brief 12-item version of the FNE and replaced the dichotomous rating with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“not at all characteristic of me”)
to 5 (“extremely characteristic of me”). The Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale
(BFNE) has good internal consistency (a = .90) and correlates highly with the original
FNE (r = .96; Leary, 1983). Moreover, it has positive correlations with other measures
of social anxiety and individuals with social phobia score significantly higher than those
with panic disorder or a community sample (Collins, Westra, Dozois, & Stewart, 2005).
However, confirmatory factor analysis revealed problems with the four reverse-scored
items (Duke, Krishnan, Faith, & Storch, 2006; Rodebaugh, Woods, et al., 2004). Thus
a revised BFNE 8-item (BFNE-II) was produced in which all items are straightforwardly
worded and the total score correlated .99 with the 12-item BFNE (Carleton, Collimore,
& Asmundson, 2007). At this point either the 8- or 12-item BFNE-II is recommended
with all items worded in a straightforward fashion. The BFNE-II items can be found in
Carleton et al. (2007).
Social Interaction Self-Statement Test
The Social Interaction Self-Statement Test (SISST) consists of 15 positive (facilitative)
and 15 negative (inhibitory) self-statements associated with heterosocial dyadic interactions (Glass, Merluzzi, Biever, & Larsen, 1982). Some researchers have eliminated
the role play and instruct individuals to rate frequency of thoughts before, during, or
after any interactions with the opposite sex (Dodge, Hope, Heimberg, & Becker, 1988).
Various studies have shown that the SISST Positive and Negative scores correlate with
other self-report measures of social anxiety (Dodge et al., 1988; Glass et al., 1982) and
individuals with social phobia score significantly higher on SISST Negative and lower
on SISST Positive than other anxiety disorder groups or nonclinical controls (Becker,
Namour, et al., 2001; Beidel et al., 1985; Turner et al., 1986), although SISST Negative subscale may be more sensitive to social anxiety than SISST Positive (Dodge et al.,
1988). Unfortunately, the SISST has limited clinical value because of its specific focus
on heterosocial interactions. A copy of the questionnaire can be found in an appendix
to Glass et al. (1982) as well as in Orsillo (2001, Appendix B).
364 TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC ANXIETY DISORDERS
Other Cognition Measures
A number of new measures have recently been developed to assess thought content in
social phobia. One that holds particular promise is the 21-item Social Thoughts and
Beliefs Scale (STABS) that assesses negative cognitions of social comparison and ineptitude in social situations (Turner, Johnson, Beidel, Heiser, & Lydiard, 2003). It has high
test–retest reliability and significantly differentiates social phobia from other anxiety
disorders. A copy of the STABS can be found in the original article. A second cognitive
measure is the 20-item Appraisal of Social Concerns (ASC) that assesses degree of perceived threat associated with various experiences relevant to social anxiety (Telch et al.,
2004). The measure correlates with other cognition and symptoms measures of social
anxiety and is sensitive to treatment effects. A copy of the instrument can be found in
the original article.
Clinician Guideline 9.15
Unfortunately, there is no standardized measure of negative cognition in social phobia that
has widespread acceptance or validation. The BFNE-II comes closest to being a measure of
negative social evaluative thoughts and beliefs that has general applicability. The SISST can
be used to assess cognitions relevant to social interactional anxiety. The STABS holds promise as providing the most direct questionnaire assessment of negative cognitions in social
phobia but more research is needed before it can be an accepted into clinical practice.
Case Conceptualization
A cognitive case formulation explicates the key cognitive and behavioral processes
responsible for heightened anxiety during the anticipatory, exposure, and postevent
processing phases of social phobia. The case formulation follows the general format
we outlined in Chapter 5 with particular application to the unique cognitive processes
proposed in the cognitive model of social phobia (see Figure 9.1). Table 9.6 presents
the main elements of the cognitive case conceptualization for social phobia as well as
examples of questions that can be used to assess each construct.
Situational Analysis
The cognitive therapist begins by identifying the full range of social situations that
the client finds anxiety-provoking and may avoid. It is important to identify mildly
anxious situations as well as those that elicit intense anxiety and avoidance. In addition it is often helpful to determine whether there are some social situations that are
not anxiety-provoking and what features of these situations make them safe for the
individual. In Table 9.6 we listed a number of other characteristics of anxious social
situations that should be assessed. The ADIS-IV and symptom measures like the SPAI
can be useful in obtaining this information. Furthermore, self-monitoring forms like the
Situational Analysis Form (Appendix 5.2) or the Daily Social Anxiety Self-Monitoring
Form (Appendix 9.1) will provide valuable information on the social situations that

366 TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC ANXIETY DISORDERS
elicit anxiety and avoidance. The therapist should review the self-monitoring form with
the client to obtain ratings on degree of avoidance associated with each recorded situation.
In our case example Gerald identified a host of performance-based and social interaction situations at work and home that elicited significant anxiety. For example, taking
a walk alone caused mild anxiety (20/100) because he might meet someone he knew,
going to the market caused moderate anxiety (40/100) because there was an increased
chance he would have to talk to a familiar person, and presenting a plan at a work meeting caused intense anxiety (100/100) because he anticipated that his anxiety would be
so severe that his mind would go blank, he would stutter, and he would really “screw
up” in front of people. Gerald identified 27 social situations that caused him mild to
intense anxiety, each one associated with moderate to strong urge to avoid.
Three Phases of Social Anxiety
There can be considerable variability across individuals in the relative importance of the
three phases of social phobia. For some individuals, like Gerald, anticipatory anxiety
was almost constantly elevated whenever he left his house because there was always a
chance he might meet someone he knew and would have to carry on a conversation.
For others anticipatory anxiety may be less prominent because their social anxiety is
confined to a few situations that occur only occasionally (e.g., making a presentation,
answering questions in a meeting). Although one might expect exposure to social situations to be invariant across individuals, this is not the case. Avoidance may be so
extensive in some individuals that they rarely are confronted with anxious social situations. Moreover, we would expect that some degree of postevent processing would be
evident in most individuals with social phobia, but here again some patients are much
more ruminative about their past social performance than others. For these individuals,
continually reliving their past embarrassment will play a critical role in the persistence
of social anxiety. Interestingly, postevent processing was not a major component of Gerald’s social anxiety. Instead anticipatory anxiety was very intense and led to a pervasive
pattern of avoidance of any potential social interaction.

anxiety.)
Social Phobia 367
Explicit Social Threat Bias
An automatic attentional bias for social threat as well as selective evaluation of social
threat cues that result in overestimated appraisals of the probability, severity, and consequences of negative evaluation by others is a core proposition in the cognitive model
of social phobia. The Apprehensive Thoughts Self-Monitoring Form (Appendix 5.4) and
the Anxious Reappraisal Form (Appendix 5.10) can be used to obtain information on
the client’s social threat bias. In addition the Social Situation Estimation Form (Appendix 9.2) is useful for obtaining online estimates of threat in social situations. There are
three critical facets of the social threat bias that the clinician must assess.
1. What is the client’s common “social threat theme” that is evident across all anxious social situations? What is the “catastrophe” or worst-case scenario that the
individual fears?
2. Estimates of the probability and severity of this dreaded outcome or its variant should be obtained for each anxious situation. Is there evidence of biased
probability and severity expectations? If so, what external social information
supports the interpretation? Is the client able to access positive information that
challenges the social threat evaluation?
3. What automatic anxious thoughts or images does the individual experience
when anticipating or participating in an anxious situation? These thoughts and
images will provide valuable information on the perceived social threat and the
maladaptive social self-schemas activated when socially anxious.
Whenever Gerald was around people, he would search for evidence that people
were looking at him, especially at his face. He was particularly self-conscious that they
might be looking at the redness of his face and thinking “This guy doesn’t look after
himself, what’s his problem?” Gerald rated the probability that people were looking at
him as very high (80/100) and the severity of their negative evaluation as very upsetting
(75/100). Some situations, such as talking to the office staff at work, were associated
with low probability and severity estimates, whereas other situations, such as carrying
on a conversation with an acquaintance at the pub, was associated with high estimates.
In the treatment sessions, exposure and cognitive restructuring began with social situations that elicited moderate levels of threat estimation.
Self-Focused Attention and Involuntary Inhibition
Excessive self-monitoring of an anxious internal state, the occurrence of inhibitory
behaviors, and poor social performance are critical processes that are assessed in the
cognitive case formulation. The cognitive therapist must determine the frequency and
extent of self-monitoring that occurs during exposure to anxious social situations. To
what extent do individuals become self-conscious in the social situation? How completely self-absorbed do they become? Are they aware of anything in their external
environment or is their focus entirely internal? Are there particular physical sensations,
symptoms, thoughts, or behaviors that become the object of their self-focus? Are they
conscious of being overly inhibited in the social situation? What perceived negative consequence is associated with the self-monitored symptom or inhibition? For example, an
368 TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC ANXIETY DISORDERS
individual might become excessively self-aware of blushing, trembling, verbal hesitations, stuttering, mind gone blank, or other involuntary inhibitory behaviors in social
situations. The self-monitoring is motivated by a desire to conceal the symptoms and
involuntary inhibitions from others in an effort to avoid a negative evaluation such as
“What’s wrong with her, she’s blushing” or “He must be terribly anxious because he is
stuttering so bad I can’t understand what he’s saying.” The Self-Consciousness Rating
Form (Appendix 9.3) can be used to obtain critical information on the role of heightened
self-focused attention in anxiety-provoking social situations. Furthermore, the Physical
Sensation Self-Monitoring Form (Appendix 5.3) and the Expanded Physical Sensations
Checklist (Appendix 5.5) can be used to determine if certain physical symptoms of
anxiety are excessively self-monitored when the person is socially anxious. Assessment
of excessive self-awareness should provide the cognitive therapist with an indication of
how the person thinks he appears to others when in social settings.
Gerald was very concerned that other people would notice that he was socially
awkward or inhibited around other people. When exposed to social interactions he
became intensely aware of blushing, his verbal hesitations and difficulty in maintaining a conversation, the tension in his muscles, and a general sense of feeling extremely
uncomfortable. Gerald was convinced that he appeared anxious and inept to others, to
put it in his words “a real arse,” who must have a serious mental illness.
Safety Behaviors
The socially phobic person’s reliance on safety-seeking strategies in order to conceal
anxiety, counter unwanted inhibitory behavior, and appear more socially competent is
another key element in the case formulation. Butler (2007) listed a number of common
safety behaviors that are seen in social anxiety such as looking at the floor to avoid eye
contact, wearing heavy makeup to hide blushing, rehearsing or mentally checking one’s
verbal comments, hiding the face or hands, speaking slowly or mumbling, avoiding
challenging or controversial comments, being accompanied by a safe person, or the like.
It is important to identify the various cognitive and behavioral safety strategies the individual uses to reduce social threat. In particular, does the client think these strategies
are effective in reducing anxiety or the social threat and does he perceive any negative
consequences associated with the safety strategy? In our case illustration, avoidance
of eye contact, slow and hesitant verbal responses (i.e., involuntary inhibitory behaviors), as well as reluctance to initiate conversation, were common coping strategies that
Gerald used to minimize social interaction. In fact these response strategies were very
prominent even in the therapy sessions. The Behavioral Responses to Anxiety Checklist
(Appendix 5.7) and the Cognitive Responses to Anxiety Checklist (Appendix 5.9) can
be useful for exploring the client’s use of safety-seeking responses.
Autobiographical Recall of Social Threat
Another important element in the cognitive case formulation is to determine whether
recall of past social experiences plays any role in the individual’s social anxiety. Are
there particular past incidents that come to memory when the client anticipates or is
exposed to a similar social situation? During postevent processing, does the individual
focus on the most recent social event, or does she recall other past experiences? Does the
Social Phobia 369
client only recall certain negative aspects of the experience or is she able to recall more
positive information as well? What is the negative interpretation or conclusion that the
client makes about that social situation? What inference is drawn about herself and
about the risk of social interaction?
Individuals will differ in how much they recall past social failures when feeling
anxious. For some individuals there may be one or two events of intense embarrassment
that come to mind when they interact with others. For others it may be the accumulative
effect of many past social encounters which are recalled as very anxiety-provoking, even
embarrassing. Whatever the case, the cognitive therapist should assess the client’s recollection and interpretation of past social events and determine their impact on current
levels of social anxiety. Gerald, for example, could not recall a particularly embarrassing social failure experience. However, it was clear that he had a tendency to recall all
the negative and threatening aspects of past social experiences, even though cognitive
restructuring revealed that these experiences were not nearly as threatening or disastrous as Gerald remembered. These memories reinforced his beliefs that “he could not
handle being with people,” “that he was different from others,” and “that he would be
better off if he socially isolated himself.”
Core Social Self-Schemas
Assessment of the previous cognitive constructs of social phobia will allow the therapist
to specify individuals’ core beliefs about the self in relation to others. These social selfschemas represent the end point of the cognitive case formulation and include how individuals believe they are seen by others. Table 9.5 lists a number of the core beliefs that
are found in social phobia. In the course of treatment a number of Gerald’s core social
self-beliefs became apparent. He believed that “others can see through me,” “people
tend to be harsh and rejecting,” “I become weak and pathetic in social situations,” and
“I can’t stand feeling anxious and uncomfortable around others.”
Clinician Guideline 9.16
A cognitive case formulation for social phobia should include (1) contextual analysis of
social situations; (2) focus on the anticipatory, exposure, and postevent processing phases
of social anxiety; (3) specification of the social threat interpretation bias; (4) assessment of
heightened self-consciousness and inhibition; (5) identification of safety-seeking responses;
(6) sampling of prominent social threat recall bias; and (7) specification of the core social
self-schemas.
